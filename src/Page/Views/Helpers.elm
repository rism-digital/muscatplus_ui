{-|

    A view helper that will either render the value of
    'body' with a given `viewFunc`, or return `Element.none`
    indicating nothing should be rendered.

    `viewFunc` can be partially applied with a `language` value
    allowing the body to be rendered in response to the user's
    selected language parameter.
