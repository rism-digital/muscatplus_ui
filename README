The only JavaScript dependency is "elm-live", a live-reloading server for Elm development. Dependency management
happens with `yarn`, so:

$ yarn install

Then:

$ yarn run develop:run

This will start up the development server and watch for changes.

The elm dependencies are installed automatically when the application is first compiled.
